The page will reload when you make changes.\

## FiveStar 
This implements a basic version of a component to give a star rating to an item, like on Amazon and similar sites. It initially displays an array of blank stars and when you click on one, the rating is displayed by filling them in

e.g.
Start status ☆☆☆☆☆
After click  ★★★★☆

If you then clicked on another star, the status would change to reflect that.

There is a reset that sets the status of the component back to the beginning.
